        <div class="contentTitle"><h1>TSUNAMI?</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p> Tsunamis are among the most destructive natural disasters that can strike our planet. These massive waves are caused by seismic activity such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides, and they can travel at high speeds across entire oceans, causing widespread devastation when they hit shorelines. Tsunamis can be devastating, causing loss of life and infrastructure damage, and their effects can be felt for years after the initial event. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>On December 26, 2004, a magnitude 9.1 earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered one of the deadliest tsunamis in history in the Indian Ocean. The resulting tsunami killed over 230,000 people and caused billions of dollars in damage in 14 countries. The devastation was so severe that a global effort was launched to improve tsunami warning systems and disaster preparedness.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> A magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck off the coast of Japan on March 11, 2011, triggering a massive tsunami that caused extensive damage and killed over 15,000 people. The tsunami also severely damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, resulting in a nuclear disaster that forced the evacuation of thousands of residents in the surrounding area. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Tsunamis have also had a significant impact on human history. A powerful earthquake off the coast of Portugal in 1755 caused a tsunami that devastated Lisbon and killed tens of thousands. The event was so significant that it prompted changes in European political and social structures, with philosophers such as Voltaire calling into question the idea of a benevolent God in the face of such destruction. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Another historic tsunami occurred in 1883 when the Krakatoa volcano in Indonesia erupted, causing a massive tsunami that killed tens of thousands of people. The eruption was one of the most powerful ever recorded, and the resulting tsunami was felt as far away as South Africa and Australia. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Tsunamis continue to pose a significant threat to coastal communities around the world, despite advances in technology and disaster preparedness. While warning systems and evacuation plans have improved, individuals and governments must remain vigilant in their efforts to reduce the impact of these devastating natural disasters. We can better prepare for future events and work towards a safer, more resilient future if we understand the history of tsunamis and their impact on society. </p>
